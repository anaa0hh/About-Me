    <p>Hello! My name is Ana and by visiting my page, I hope you begin to get an idea of who I am and my interests. I was born in Anaheim, California but spent most of my childhood in a city called Moreno Valley. There's not really anything there so it's not that great, but things are close enough to where you don't have to hate it. </p>

    <ul>-Rupaul's Drag Race</ul>
    <ul>-The Office</ul>
    <ul>-Dexter</ul>
    <ul>-Grey's Anatomy</ul>
    <ul>-How to get away with Murder</ul>
    <ul>-New Girl</ul>
    <ul>-It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia</ul>
    <ul>Shameless</ul>
    <ul>Stranger Things</ul>
    <ul>Nathan for You</ul>

    <p>In my free time, I listen to podcasts a lot. My favorite genre is true crime. Here is a list of some of the ones I enjoy listening to:
