<h1>All About Me!</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Ana and by visiting my page, I hope you begin to get an idea of who I am and my interests. I was born in Anaheim, California but spent most of my childhood in a city called Moreno Valley. There's not really anything there so it's not that great, but things(the beach, amusement parks, Los Angeles, San Diego) are close enough to where you don't have to hate it. 
</p>
<p>In my free time, I listen to podcasts a lot. My favorite genre is true crime. Here is a list of some of the ones I enjoy listening to:
<ul>
<ol>Sword and Scale</ol>
<ol>My Favorite Murder</ol>
<ol>Small Town Murder</ol>
<ol>This American Life</ol>
<ol>Serial(Season 1)</ol>
<ol>Into the Dark</ol>
</ul>
